# @teuportal/contracts-client

Placeholder workspace for the generated TypeScript client. The build will consume the OpenAPI document emitted by `apps/core-api-spring` (see `target/openapi.json`) and output a typed SDK consumed by Nuxt.

Generation scripts will land alongside the first OpenAPI-contract-backed endpoint.
